CS-220 Spring 2017 Lab 10 answers		Due: April 25, 2017

1. Cut and paste a copy of your successful test.txt file that creates a texthex.txt 
   file that invokes the target function:
   C danielhintzaaadanielhintzadanielhintzdanielhintzadanielhintzdanielhintzadanielhintzdanielhintzanielhintz
   X 500640

2. Notice that the target function in target.c ends with an "exit(0)" invocation.  The
   "exit(0)" causes the target function to return directly to the operating system cleanup
   routine instead of to the function that called "target".  If the target function had 
   ended with "return false" instead of "exit(0)", would target still run sucessfully?
   If not, what might happen and why?

   Possible segmentation fault, the return address could be broken

3. If target.c had used fgets instead of gets, would your buffer overflow attack have been succesful?
   Why or why not?

   No because it would've stopped reading the input after the max length
   
4. Did the Makefile make this lab easier or harder to run?  Is it worth the time to build a correct
   Makefile so that dependencies are automatically taken care of?

   Much easier, definitely worth the time to make a good Makefile
   
5. Now that you know how to do a buffer overflow attack, could you do a buffer overflow
   attack on target WITHOUT looking at target.c?  If not, why not?  If so, what tools
   would you use to figure out what is in the "target" executable file?

   It would be much harder not being able to look at the source code, BUT you could dump the assembly and potentially still do it
